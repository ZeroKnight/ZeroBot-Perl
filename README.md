ZeroBot 
=========

My personal, batshit insane IRC bot
-------------------------------------

This IRC bot serves no major purpose other than to amuse myself and friends in
the IRC channels that I frequent, thus it doesn't do anything overly special; it
is simply a pet project :)

Backstory that you probably don't care about
----------------------------------------------

I started writing ZeroBot in Python roughly around December 2011. After some
time, I grew to dislike Python for various reasons and pretty much abandoned my
poor bot, forgetting it even existed for a while. Some time later, yearning for
the deranged antics of my old bot, and keeping a collection of humorous quotes,
I decided to re-write my old bot in a language that wasn't Python.

First I chose C++ as I quite enjoy the language, but not being very proficient
with it, it took more time than I would have liked for a side-project. However,
wanting to learn Perl I decided to jump back in yet again and write up my old
beloved bot in Perl.

I'm writing the Bot not only for fun and recreation in IRC, but as a
learning experience. At the time of writing, I'm not all that great of a
programmer yet.

Huh? You're still here? Okay, uh...
-------------------------------------

If you happen upon this Bot, do what you will with it. Just remember that this
is in fact a *personal* project, so don't expect anything to concise, elegent,
or make any ounce of sense at all. Also, it should go without saying there wont
be much of any docs. I'll stop rambling now.
