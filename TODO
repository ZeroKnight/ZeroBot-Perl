ZeroBot ToDo List, updated: May 05, 2014 @ 14:55:53

Core
-------

* Use PoCo::IRC::Plugin::Proxy to allow for transparent bot restarts/reloads
    + Ability to add/modify commands and subroutines without disconnecting
    + In the same sense, IRC connection is not lost on crashes
        - Might make crashes a bit hard to notice... perhaps proxy can make use
          of some kind of heartbeat to check on the bot and quit with a silly
          message (eg. "Whoops, lost my ghost", "gtg, just died inside").

* Core will be as minimal as possible, and various bot functions should be
  modules that can be dynamically loaded (eg. !loadmod quotes)

Modules
----------

* chat-quote
    + Quote database.
* chat-babelbaba
    + Separate "quote" database for Wazubaba's native language. Will randomly
      return a "quote" from this db (or at random, ?????) as a "translation"
      whenever Wazubaba utters gibberish. Only Wazubaba and certain ranked
      members may add to this database.
* chat-badcmd
    + Taunt the user for entering an improperly typed command
* chat-joingreet
    + Greet channel residents when the bot joins a channel
* chat-lolxeno
    + Ruthlessly taunt that disgrace of a creature whenever it shamelessly spews
      lexical diarrhea onto our screens
* chat-name
    + Mentally unstable and obnoxious responses to being mentioned by name
* chat-right
    + Respond in various yes/no fashion from a list of phrases when asked for
      confirmation (eg. "Right, ZeroBot?" "Go fuck yourself.").

        - * dumbass slaps prettycoolguy around with a large fishbot

* puppet
    + Force the bot to say or act something in a channel, or send raw data
