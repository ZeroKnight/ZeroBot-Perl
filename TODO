ZeroBot ToDo List, updated: May 05, 2014 @ 14:55:53

Core
-------

* Use PoCo::IRC::Plugin::Proxy to allow for transparent bot restarts/reloads
    + Ability to add/modify commands and subroutines without disconnecting
    + In the same sense, IRC connection is not lost on crashes
        - Might make crashes a bit hard to notice... perhaps proxy can make use
          of some kind of heartbeat to check on the bot and quit with a silly
          message (eg. "Whoops, lost my ghost", "gtg, just died inside").

* Core will be as minimal as possible, and various bot functions should be
  modules that can be dynamically loaded (eg. !loadmod chat-quote)

Modules
----------

* Implement module system. Allow said modules to be dynamically (un)loaded
    + Idea from graphitemaster's redroid to denote module type
        - CMD (only on command), ALL (on any message; conditionals help), TIME
          (module will be run on a periodic basis)
    + For now, hardcode everything encased in a conditional to let "modules" be
      "(un)loaded" at will
* For games and similar (ie. nguess, 8ball, etc) that need randomized phrases
  for various reasons, use a 'misc_phrases' table with a 'module' column that
  modules may reference when they need to pull a phrase.

Actual Module ToDo List
--------------------------

* chat-joingreet
    + extend to greet people who join the channel (move to separate module?)
    + use existing chat_joingreet table with separate entries for others
      joining, mark with a bool 'others' column of sorts
* chat-panda
    + ZeroBot lurvs teh pandar. Say nice things about her, and/or sexually
      explicit things.
* chat-quote
    + Quote database.
* chat-babelbaba
    + Separate "quote" database for Wazubaba's native language. Will randomly
      return a "quote" from this db (or at random, ?????) as a "translation"
      whenever Wazubaba utters gibberish. Only Wazubaba and certain ranked
      members may add to this database.
* chat-lolxeno
    + Ruthlessly taunt that disgrace of a creature whenever it shamelessly spews
      lexical diarrhea onto our screens
* silencer
    + Kick and/or ban users for uttering certain phrases or words
        - * dumbass slaps prettycoolguy around with a large fishbot
          * dumbass was kicked by ZeroBot [ 'Get the fuck off qwebirc' ]
* puppet
    + Force the bot to say or act something in a channel, or send raw data
* game-21
    + A game of Blackjack
* dns
    + Resolve DNS records
* youtube
    + Counts and keeps track of youtube links. Shameless rip from redroid
* twss
    + Counts number of times that they said it. Shameless rip from redroid
* eval
    + Evaluate mathematical expressions and code
        - Support for languages other than perl? Like Lua? Python? etc
        - Can fork() for safety and get result from that somehow, maybe via a
          file descriptor or socket
